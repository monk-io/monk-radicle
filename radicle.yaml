    description: |
      Radicle is a peer-to-peer code collaboration and version control platform built on a decentralized network.
      It is designed to provide developers with a secure and transparent way to collaborate on code without relying on centralized services such as GitHub.
      Radicle uses a novel approach to distributed version control, in which code changes are stored and propagated across a network of peers, rather than on a centralized server.
      This allows developers to work together in a highly resilient and secure environment, without having to trust any single point of failure.
      Radicle also provides features such as code review, issue tracking, and pull requests, making it a complete collaboration platform for decentralized development teams.
      Overall, Radicle is a powerful and innovative tool for building decentralized and collaborative software projects.
